  Installing Dependencies and Configuring the Project:
    Step 1: In Android Studio, open the build.gradle (Module: app) file.

Running and Testing the Application:
  Running the App on an Android Emulator or a Real Device:
  Step 1: Creating an Emulator (If Not Already Created)
  In Android Studio, click on the "AVD Manager" (Android Virtual Device Manager) icon in the upper right corner.
  Click "Create Virtual Device" and select a device profile for your device (e.g. Pixel 3).
  Download the desired Android version and complete the AVD configuration.
  Click the "Play" icon to launch the created AVD.
  Step 2: Running the Application
  Click on the "Run" button in the top menu of Android Studio.
  If the application behaves unexpectedly or gives errors, observe the errors using the "Logcat" section at the bottom of Android Studio.
  Errors are usually shown in red text. Examine the error messages and the line at which the application crashes.
  
Notes:
  If you are using a real Android device instead of an emulator, make sure to enable "USB Debugging" under "Developer Options" on your device.
  It is important to test the app's performance and user interface on a variety of devices and screen sizes to ensure its suitability for a wide range of users.
